function X = NonlinearTriangulation(K, C1, R1, C2, R2, x1, x2, X0)
%% Notes:
% (INPUT) C1 and R1: the 1st camera pose
% (INPUT) C2 and R2: the 2nd camera pose
% (INPUT) x1 and x2: two Nx2 matrices whose row represents correspondence 
%                    between the 1st and 2nd images where N is the number 
%                    of correspondences.
% (INPUT and OUTPUT) X: Nx3 matrix whose row represents 3D triangulated point.
