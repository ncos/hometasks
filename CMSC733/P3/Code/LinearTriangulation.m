function [X] = LinearTriangulation(K, C1, R1, C2, R2, x1, x2)
%% Inputs:
% C1 and R1: the 1st camera pose
% C2 and R2: the 2nd camera pose
% x1 and x2: two Nx2 matrices whose row represents correspondence between the 
%            1st and 2nd images where N is the number of correspondences.
%% Outputs: 
% X: Nx3 matrix whose row represents 3D triangulated point.
