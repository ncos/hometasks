The code is in Part1/code and Part2/Code. Run executables ./pin_it.py --method=G1D (or G3D or GMM) and ./pblite.py. The averager.py in Part1 is for generating gaussian parameters for 3 dimensional gaussians. For part 2 - default parameters should suffice, the run_all.sh script should run ./pblite.py for all test images and put the .png files into the appropriate Benchmark folder (although other files are in .jpg to save space). You might need to install pyopencv, numpy, scipy or a number of other things - follow the error messages!)
